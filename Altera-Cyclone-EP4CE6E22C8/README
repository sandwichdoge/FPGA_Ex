Install Quartus II (v18.1).
Choose packages that support Cyclone 4 board.
Install USB-Blaster driver for Windows.

Create a schematic file (*.bdf).
Create a verilog file for our counter (*.v), write some code.
Create a clock source:
- Tools -> IP Catalog -> Search for "ALTPLL".
- Double-click on it, generate a Verilog file.
- Configure its parameters (frequency..).
Go to schematic tab, right-click -> select Insert -> Symbol
Place the newly created clock in the schematic, and connect the clkout pin to our counter.
Go to schematic tab, right-click -> select Insert -> Symbol
Place a primitive input pin to the inclk0 pin of the PLL clock.

Select Assignments -> Pin Planner.
Assign a clock pin to the primitive input pin we just placed.

Select Processing -> Start Compilation.

Select Tools -> Programmer.
Select "Add files.." -> Select our output file (*.sof)
Click "Auto-detect" button so the software detects which board we're programming for.
Click Start to program the FPGA.
